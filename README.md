# cheevos

Cheevos is an app to let people award custom achivements (Cheevos) to their
friends and colleages.

## Organizations

Users are grouped together into Organizations. An organization represents a
boundary for cheevos. Every cheevo is owned by a single organization and can
only be awarded to members of that organization by the members of that same
organization.

Users can be members of multiple organizations and collect cheevos from all
of them, but the cheevos are tied to their status as members of that
organization. If they are removed from the organization in the future, the
cheevos they received from the organization are also removed.
